In 1958 Heider published a book on what he called ‘naive psychology’ and, interchangeably, ‘commonsense psychology’; now more commonly referred to as folk psychology. 
Although widely ignored,[^unknown] 
no comparably detailed work on folk psychology has yet appeared.

[^unknown]: To illustrate, the work is not cited in an recent collection of some of the best work on folk psychology \citep{hutto:2007_folk}; nor does Dennett, who claims to have introduced the term ‘folk psychology’ \citep[pp.~73--74]{dennett:2014_intuition}, mention Heider’s book.

Heider’s overall aim is to advance ‘[t]he scientific study of interpersonal relations’ or, as we say, social interactions \citep[p.~3]{heider:1958_psychology}.
He views naive psychology as having a central role in achieving this aim. 

Heider offers two ways of characterising naive psychology. 
On the first,

> ‘the unformulated or half-formulated knowledge of interpersonal relations as it is expressed in our everyday language and experience [...] will be referred to as common-sense or naive psychology’ \citep[p.~4]{heider:1958_psychology} 

Like subsequent authors (including \citet[p.~140]{clark:1987_folk} and \citet[pp.~73--74]{dennett:2014_intuition}), Heider makes an analogy with naive physics.
